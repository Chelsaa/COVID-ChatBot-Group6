• Monoclonal antibodies are laboratory-produced molecules that act as substitute antibodies that can restore,enhance or mimic the immune system's attack on cells.
• Monoclonal antibodies for COVID-19 may block the virus that causes COVID-19 from attaching to human cells, making it more difficult for the virus to reproduce and cause harm. 
• Monoclonal antibodies may also neutralize a virus.

8. Can I get coronavirus from food,food packaging or food containers and preparation area?
Ans. Yes, you can get coronavirus from surfaces.It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems likely to behave like other coronaviruses. A recent review of the survival of human coronaviruses on surfaces found large variability, ranging from 2 hours to 9 days (11). The survival time depends on a number of factors, including the type of surface, temperature, relative humidity and specific strain of the virus.

9. To whom I should contact with Drug-Related questions?

10. Nutrition guidelines for adults during the COVID-19 outbreak.
Ans. Proper nutrition and hydration are vital. People who eat a well-balanced diet tend to be healthier with stronger immune systems and lower risk of chronic illnesses and infectious diseases. So you should eat a variety of fresh and unprocessed foods every day to get the vitamins, minerals, dietary fibre, protein and antioxidants your body needs. Drink enough water. Avoid sugar, fat and salt to significantly lower your risk of overweight, obesity, heart disease, stroke, diabetes and certain types of cancer.
• Eat fruits, vegetables, legumes (e.g. lentils, beans), nuts and whole grains
• Daily, eat: 2 cups of fruit (4 servings), 2.5 cups of vegetables (5 servings), 180 g of grains, and 160 g of meat and beans.
• For snacks, choose raw vegetables and fresh fruit rather than foods that are high in sugar, fat or salt.

• When using canned or dried vegetables and fruit, choose varieties without added salt or sugar.
• Drink enough water every day

11. If a worker in my food processing facility/farm has tested positive for COVID-19, Should I close the facility? If so, for how long?
Ans. Food facilities need to follow protocols set by local and state health departments, which may vary depending on the amount of 
community spread of COVID-19 in a given area. These decisions will be based on public health risk of person-to-person transmission not based on food safety.

12. What are some ways to maintain a healthy diet during the COVID-19 pandemic?
Ans. Every day, eat a combination of different foods including whole grains such as wheat, maize and rice, legumes like lentils and beans, 
fruit and vegetables and some foods from animal sources (e.g. meat, fish, eggs and milk).
Eat plenty of fruit and vegetables:

● Eat fresh fruit and vegetables that are in season.
● Eat a variety of fruit and vegetables.

Keep salt intake to less than 5 g per day (approximately 1 teaspoon):

● Use less salt during cooking and preparing food and use iodized salt.
● Check the labels on food and choose products with lower sodium content.
● Limit processed and prepackaged foods, which can be full of hidden sodium.
● Remove the salt shaker from the table, and instead use fresh or dried herbs and spices for added flavour.

14. Can i make my own hand sanitiser?
Ans. The FDA does not recommend that consumers make their own hand sanitizer. If made incorrectly, hand sanitizer can be ineffective, and there have been reports of skin burns from homemade hand sanitizer. The agency lacks verifiable information on the methods being used to prepare hand sanitizer at home and whether they are safe for use on human skin.   

15. What do i do if i get a rash or other reaction to hand sanitiser?
Ans. Call your doctor if you experience a serious reaction to hand sanitizer. The FDA encourages consumers and health care professionals to report adverse events experienced with the use of hand sanitizers to the FDA’s MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program.
